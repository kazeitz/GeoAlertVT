This is a prototype application implementation of the GeoVTAlerts which utilizes push notifications 
and user geospatial awareness to map a user's location and show nearby relevant and also all active  
VT alerts messages.  The application has been built on top of the CNS provided android push library 
and demo application.  Therefore, an installer certificate (in pkcs12/p12 format) is needed and
should be placed into the res/raw directory.  The Virginia Tech sandbox testing environment is
utilized and alerts were sent through the use of a prototype web application.  Further developments
and testing are needed to ensure the robustness and scalability of this application which has not
undergone rigorous testing.  Development based on interface iterations and additional features
is ongoing.  As such, this is the basic proof of concept.
